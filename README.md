# 'Ally' - Meet your 'allies'

tldr: "Like tinder but for friends and instead of pics it's interests + your expertise level"

## **Project Pitch: "Ally"**

### 1) **Type of Project:** 
Mobile Application

### 2) **Core Problem/Idea:** 
Finding new friends with niche interests within a certain distance of oneself. Balancing anonymity and safety of vulnerable groups. There's a gap for those who want to connect on a deeper, interest-based level without the pressure of popularity or money.

### 3) **Crucial Content:** 
- **Profiles:** Instead of photos, users list their interests and rate their expertise level (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert). 
- **Matching Algorithm:** (or AI) Connects users based on shared interests and complementary expertise levels.
- **Safety Features:** Users can only see the general vicinity of others, not exact locations. Direct messaging is unlocked only after mutual interest is established. All chats are monitored for safety using AI.
- **Anonymity:** Users can choose pseudonyms, but a verified .edu email is required. (reason: children & pedophiles ;( )
- **Ratings:** Leave reviews on people you chat with, for others to see. Potentially abusable.
- **Paid promotional posts:** Post an advertisement for services, such as nail work, tutoring, etc. Businesses may also be interested. TBD, low-priority feature.
- **Events:** Optional, meetup-style events. 
### 4) **Target Audience:** 
- Individuals looking to make genuine friendships based on shared interests.
- Professionals or hobbyists seeking to connect with others in their field or interest area.
- Vulnerable groups who value anonymity but want to connect with others safely. ex: celebrities, whistleblowers

### 5) **Resources/Materials Needed:** 
- App development team (UI/UX designers, backend and frontend developers).
- Safety and moderation team.
- Marketing and community outreach team.
- Server and cloud storage for user data and chat histories.

### 6) **Similarities/Comparisons to Similar Projects:** 
- **Tinder:** Uses swiping mechanism but focuses on dating and physical appearances. Algorithm focuses on maximizing matches for paid users, not on creating long conversations or positive connections.
- **Meetup:** Focuses on group activities and events rather than one-on-one connections.
- **YikYak:** If you've used yikyak you know.
- **Anonymous chat apps:** Offer anonymity but lack the safety and interest-based connection features.


### 7) **What Makes it Entertaining/Engaging?** 
- Socializing
- The opportunity to learn from others, especially if they have a higher expertise level in a shared interest.
- Safety features and the balance of anonymity provide a secure environment, making users more comfortable and likely to engage.
